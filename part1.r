# Deﬁne the tested regions;

# Create the observed signal with the vectorized pixels of
# these three regions using windows of 20 × 20 pixels;

# Check the data behavior to verify if the considered regression
# models are suitable approaches to ﬁt such data;

# Create two dummy covariates;

# Fit the selected regression models. You can use the functions
# available on Canvas.

# Perform the detection theory. Are the covariates signiﬁcant to the
# model? Are they introducing information about variations in y?

# Test the residuals. Is the model correctly speciﬁed? (Consider a
# residual vs index plot and check evidence of normality with a
# histogram, for example).

# Check the relationship between the mean of y and the dummy covariates.

# Verify the determination coeﬃcient for the ﬁtted models.

# In conclusion: what is the most accurate model for such data,
# considering detection and modeling evaluation?
