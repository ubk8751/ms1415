# Split the data set in to test and validation part, separating the last
# 10 observed values to evaluate the forecasting;

# Check the data behavior to identify suitable approaches to ﬁt such data;
# Fit the Gaussian-base and model based on suitable distributions. To ﬁt,
# for example, the beta and Kumaraswamy-based ARMA models (βARMA
# model and KARMA model, respectively), you can use the functions available
# on Canvas.

# Evaluate the ﬁtted models.

# Test the residuals. Are the models suitable for the tested data sets?

# Evaluate the prediction capability of the tested models in the test and
# validation data sets.

# In conclusion: what is the most accurate model for such data?
